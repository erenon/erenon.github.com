A non-exhaustive list of non-fiction books in no particular order I read recently,
with some recommendation. This post was inspired
by the [similar posts][] of [Eli Bendersky][].

## Environment

 - [Limits To Growth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/705418.The_Limits_to_Growth)
   by Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows, JÃ¸rgen Randers.
   A long time ago, a group of scientists built a computer model to guess
   how the apparently limitless growth of the economy will affect
   the future of humankind. The results were published in 1972,
   urging profound and immediate changes.
   Not much change was made. The 30 year update of the book confirms
   that we are on track to our predicted doom, and again proposes
   reduction of consumption, waste, greed; a fair society and more birth control
   as a solution. A depressing read, forecasting the untimely death of billions
   in this century.
