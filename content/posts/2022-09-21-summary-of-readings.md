## Environment

 - [Limits To Growth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/705418.The_Limits_to_Growth)
   by Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows, JÃ¸rgen Randers.
   A long time ago, a group of scientists built a computer model to guess
   how the apparently limitless growth of the economy will affect
   the future of humankind. The results were published in 1972,
   urging profound and immediate changes.
   Not much change was made. The 30 year update of the book confirms
   that we are on track to our predicted doom, and again proposes
   reduction of consumption, waste, greed; a fair society and more birth control
   as a solution. A depressing read, forecasting the untimely death of billions
   in this century.

## Software

 - [The Making of Prince of Persia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52824295-the-making-of-prince-of-persia)
   by Jordan Mechner.
   Relevant journal entries verbatim, from the author of the famous computer game,
   around 1985-1993. Shows how Jordan struggles between game development and screenwriting,
   and the fascinating self-doubt of an extremely talented and professionally successful youth.
   Easy to read, exciting, inspirational.

 - [Masters of Doom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146.Masters_of_Doom) by David Kushner.
   A documentary on how the computer game developer company _id_ was founded and operated,
   from Commander Keen through Doom to Quake I-II, mostly focusing on John Carmack and John Romero,
   their different personalities and motivations -- without technical details.
