A non-exhaustive list of non-fiction books in no particular order I read recently,
with some recommendation. This post was inspired
by the [similar posts][] of [Eli Bendersky][].

## History

 - [The Jewish War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415654.The_Jewish_War) by Flavius Josephus.
    An account centered on the Jewish rebellion against the Roman around A.D. 66, starting before
    Herod the Great, ending after the destruction of Jerusalem. Long and detailed, but with many
    factual errors (and suspected cosmetics), from Josephus, once a Jewish general of the rebellion,
    turned to writing after falling captive to Vespasianus. Take away: apparently, people changed
    little in 2000 years: greed, hubris, envy, cruelty: nothing new. Also: Herod had every reason to get mad.
