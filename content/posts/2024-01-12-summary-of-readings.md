A non-exhaustive list of non-fiction books in no particular order I read recently,
with some recommendation. This post was inspired
by the [similar posts][] of [Eli Bendersky][].

## History

 - [The Jewish War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415654.The_Jewish_War) by Flavius Josephus.
    An account centered on the Jewish rebellion against the Roman around A.D. 66, starting before
    Herod the Great, ending after the destruction of Jerusalem. Long and detailed, but with many
    factual errors (and suspected cosmetics), from Josephus, once a Jewish general of the rebellion,
    turned to writing after falling captive to Vespasianus. Take away: apparently, people changed
    little in 2000 years: greed, hubris, envy, cruelty: nothing new. Also: Herod had every reason to get mad.

## Science

  - [Breaking Through: My Life in Science](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/123025953) by Katalin Karik√≥.
    Autobiography of the Nobel laureate mRNS pioneer, who played a great role in developing a COVID-19 vaccine.
    Also a story of how an extremely determined girl from a family of simple means achieves
    great success, through sheer will a continuous work - for decades.
    I'd also like to acknowledge the seemingly unwavering support of her family.
    There's not much about COVID itself, books are referenced instead that explain it in details.
    The second part (after Penn) felt rushed, the development mostly unclear to me.
    I suppose _Kati_ had some reading due...
    The writing is not great - it is clearly written by a scientist.

## Finance

  - [Straight to Hell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21535674-straight-to-hell) by John LeFevre.
    Terrific stories about terrible people, written by someone who portrays himself as a similarly terrible
    person, with a value system completely foreign to me. The (supposedly true) stories are entertaining
    in a cringe way. Going through this book was the reading equivalent of the guilty pleasure inducing
    overeating of chocolate cookies.
