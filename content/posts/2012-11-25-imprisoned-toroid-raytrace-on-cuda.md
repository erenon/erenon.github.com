The following video is created by a C++/CUDA program using the theory of raytracing
which was the most interesting piece of knowledge I learned on the university this semester.

Because of its as-good-as-it-should-be quality of the source, I can't opensource it at this precise moment.
Meanwhile, take a look at [OptiX][1], which I found a month later I had completed this.

The video was rendered at 24 FPS, render time appr. 3 hours.
