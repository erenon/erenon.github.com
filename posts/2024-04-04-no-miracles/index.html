  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>One would argue that miracles do not exist.</p>
<p>Long time ago, a prominent member of a now mostly abandoned web forum offered to lend
a technical book (JavaScript: The Good Parts) to me, an absolute unknown nobody. For free. No strings attached.
Obviously, it isn&rsquo;t a miracle, just a selfless act of kindness. I was still flattered.</p>
<p>15 years later, I was wondering what happened to him. His blog had a very memorable domain name.
Lacking a device, I couldn&rsquo;t check it out immediately, and the memory faded. The very next day,
a post from that very blog popped up in my RSS reader, coming through the HackerNews &ldquo;best&rdquo; feed.
A feed that selects the top few posts of thousands of submissions all over the world.
A lucky coincidence, we can conclude, no miracle.</p>
<p><a href="https://20y.hu/~slink/journal/xylophone-duplo/">The article</a> is about a scientific experiment (if you squint a bit). Given the connection above,
I felt compelled to verify the results by reproduction, especially because I had all the required resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some colored pieces of DUPLO</li>
<li>A xylophone of matching (somewhat) colors</li>
<li>An interested toddler</li>
</ul>
<p>Please find the anonymized results of the reproduced experiment in the diagram below (Figure 1):</p>
<p><figure>
  <img src="/img/xylophone.jpg" alt="Colored duplo pieces arranged in a matrix, with two figures at opposite corners, and a similarly colored xylophone">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>I can confirm that, in accordance with the original research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toddler beating the xylophone can instruct papa correctly to find the daughter</li>
<li>Toddler listening to the xylophone can move the daughter correctly to find papa</li>
<li>and have fun in the meantime</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collectibe flowers can be added to the map, and a mini inventory (separate flat piece),
so the daughter can find and properly greet mama</li>
<li>Introducing windows that can be opened and climbed through works</li>
<li>Only listening to the xylophone without looking at the colors doesn&rsquo;t work</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, you can have this simple, no-computer equipment, and still have fun with your kid,
science concur. So we experiment, explore, build and laugh together, freely.</p>
<p>And one might argue, that miracles do not exist.</p>
