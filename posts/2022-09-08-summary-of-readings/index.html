<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53011383-unix">UNIX: A History and a Memoir</a> by Brian Kernighan.
A very interesting story of how the original Unix was invented - as seen by Brian,
and how now-familiar tools were developed alongside.
Recommended for the users of UNIX derivative systems, and tools like bash, make, awk, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/160171.Just_for_Fun">Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary</a>, by Linus Torvalds and David Diamond.

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39996759">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout.

The author tells how the theorem was finally solved, starting with the ancient greeks and ending up
at modern mathematics. Unfortunately, to remain comprehensible for casual readers,
there are not much mathematical details. I think this is not the authors fault &ndash; modern mathematics simply
transcended most of us.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733505-a-man-for-all-markets">A Man for All Markets</a> by Edward O. Thorp.
An autobiography telling a story of how a poor, but super intelligent boy discovers the world,
and denies the &ldquo;it cannot be done&rdquo; sentiment. From university through Las Vegas to Wall Street.

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24724602">Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt</a> by Michael Lewis.
A fun, easy to read, short story about high frequency trading in the US, based on actual events.
Unfortunately, some argue it is incorrect, factually wrong, written in bad faith, or simply an ad of a specific exchange.
There&rsquo;s even a rebuttal book. Still, it is a fun read.</li>
</ul>
